## 📊 Data Sources

The application uses Snowflake's BILLING schema views:

| View | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **PARTNER_USAGE_IN_CURRENCY_DAILY** | Daily credit and currency usage by account |
| **PARTNER_REMAINING_BALANCE_DAILY** | Daily balance snapshots (capacity, rollover, free usage) |
| **PARTNER_CONTRACT_ITEMS** | Contract terms, capacity, and dates |
| **PARTNER_RATE_SHEET_DAILY** | Effective rates for usage calculation |

---

## 🔐 Security & Permissions

**Important:** The Streamlit app runs as the viewing user, not as a service account.

### Required Permissions
Users need:
- ✅ `SELECT` access to `SNOWFLAKE.BILLING.*` views
- ✅ `USAGE` on the warehouse
- ✅ `USAGE` on the Streamlit app

### What Gets Created
The deployment script (`deploy.sql`) creates:
- **Role**: `BILLING_DASHBOARD_USER` with BILLING schema access
- **Warehouse**: `BILLING_DASHBOARD_WH` (XSMALL, auto-suspend 60s)
- **Streamlit App**: `billing_dashboard` with embedded code
- **Proper Grants**: Secure access to billing data

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **"Table doesn't exist"** | Verify BILLING schema access with Snowflake Support |
| **"Permission denied"** | Ensure ACCOUNTADMIN role or proper grants |
| **"No data" in dashboard** | Check date range, billing data availability, and filters |
| **Cache issues** | Press `C` in app to clear cache, then rerun |
| **Column name errors** | Ensure you're using the latest version of `streamlit_app.py` |

### Quick Verification
```sql
-- Test BILLING schema access
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM SNOWFLAKE.BILLING.PARTNER_USAGE_IN_CURRENCY_DAILY;

-- Verify app status
SHOW STREAMLIT APPS;
DESC STREAMLIT billing_dashboard;

-- Check warehouse
SHOW WAREHOUSES LIKE 'BILLING_DASHBOARD_WH';
```

---

## 🔄 Maintenance

### Updating the Application
```sql
-- Replace the Streamlit code
CREATE OR REPLACE STREAMLIT billing_dashboard
    QUERY_WAREHOUSE = 'BILLING_DASHBOARD_WH'
AS
$$ 
-- Paste new streamlit_app.py code here
$$;
```

### Monitoring Costs
```sql
-- Monitor warehouse usage
SELECT * 
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY 
WHERE WAREHOUSE_NAME = 'BILLING_DASHBOARD_WH'
ORDER BY START_TIME DESC
LIMIT 100;

-- Check app query history
SELECT * 
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY
WHERE WAREHOUSE_NAME = 'BILLING_DASHBOARD_WH'
ORDER BY START_TIME DESC
LIMIT 100;
```
