# Schema Verification & Calculation Review

## Issue Summary
The Contract Usage Report was throwing a SQL compilation error:
```
(1304): 01bf91ec-3201-ff0c-0007-ac5a00ea0ec6: 000904 (42000): SQL compilation error: 
error line 4 at position 12 invalid identifier 'CAPACITY_TYPE_NAME'
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Missing Column: CAPACITY_TYPE_NAME
**Location:** Line 783 in `streamlit_app.py`

**Issue:** The SQL query in the `load_contract_data()` function was attempting to SELECT a column called `CAPACITY_TYPE_NAME` from `SNOWFLAKE.BILLING.PARTNER_CONTRACT_ITEMS`, but this column does not exist in your database schema.

**Impact:** 
- ‚úÖ **No functional impact** - The column was selected but never used anywhere in the application code
- üîß **Already Fixed** - Removed `CAPACITY_TYPE_NAME` from the SELECT statement

### 2. Verification Steps

To verify the fix and validate your schema, please run the queries in `verify_schema.sql`. This will:

1. ‚úÖ List all available columns in `PARTNER_CONTRACT_ITEMS`
2. ‚úÖ Confirm whether `CAPACITY_TYPE_NAME` exists (should return 0)
3. ‚úÖ Show sample contract data
4. ‚úÖ Identify any alternative capacity-related columns
5. ‚úÖ Verify all columns required for calculations are present
6. ‚úÖ Test the calculation formula
7. ‚úÖ Check for NULL values that might affect calculations

## Calculation Validation

### Contract Capacity Calculation
**Location:** Line 449 in `streamlit_app.py`

```python
capacity_purchased = contract['CONTRACTED_AMOUNT'] + 
                    contract.get('ROLLOVER_AMOUNT', 0) + 
                    contract.get('FREE_USAGE_AMOUNT', 0)
```

**Formula Verification:**
- ‚úÖ **Mathematically Correct**: Sums all capacity sources
- ‚úÖ **NULL Handling**: Uses `.get()` with default value of 0
- ‚úÖ **Business Logic**: Aligns with standard contract capacity calculation

**Components:**
1. **CONTRACTED_AMOUNT** - Base capacity purchased in the contract
2. **ROLLOVER_AMOUNT** - Unused capacity rolled over from previous period (defaults to 0)
3. **FREE_USAGE_AMOUNT** - Promotional or free usage credits (defaults to 0)

### Usage Calculation
**Location:** Line 462 in `streamlit_app.py`

```python
total_used = customer_usage['USAGE_IN_CURRENCY'].sum()
```

**Formula Verification:**
- ‚úÖ **Correct**: Sums all usage within the contract period
- ‚úÖ **Date Filtering**: Only includes usage between contract start and end dates (lines 452-456)
- ‚úÖ **Currency Consistency**: Uses USAGE_IN_CURRENCY which matches contract currency

### Overage Calculation
**Location:** Line 465 in `streamlit_app.py`

```python
overage = max(0, total_used - capacity_purchased)
```

**Formula Verification:**
- ‚úÖ **Mathematically Correct**: Calculates positive overage only
- ‚úÖ **Edge Cases**: Returns 0 if usage is below capacity (using max function)

### Run Rate Projections

#### Daily Run Rate (Line 480)
```python
daily_rate = recent_usage['USAGE_IN_CURRENCY'].sum() / actual_days
```
- ‚úÖ **Correct**: Average daily consumption over recent period
- ‚úÖ **Configurable Period**: Uses `run_rate_days` parameter (default 30 days)

#### Days Until Overage (Line 484)
```python
days_until_overage = remaining_capacity / daily_rate
```
- ‚úÖ **Mathematically Correct**: Projects depletion date based on current run rate
- ‚úÖ **Edge Cases Handled**:
  - Returns 0 if already over capacity (line 486)
  - Returns contract days remaining if daily rate is 0 (line 488)

#### Annual Run Rate (Line 491)
```python
annual_run_rate = daily_rate * 365
```
- ‚úÖ **Mathematically Correct**: Projects annual consumption
- ‚úÖ **Business Value**: Used for renewal recommendations

### Percentage Utilization (Line 509)
```python
used_percent = (total_used / capacity_purchased * 100) if capacity_purchased > 0 else 0
```
- ‚úÖ **Mathematically Correct**: Percentage of capacity consumed
- ‚úÖ **Division by Zero Protection**: Returns 0 if capacity is 0

## Required Columns from PARTNER_CONTRACT_ITEMS

The application requires these columns (all standard in Snowflake's PARTNER_CONTRACT_ITEMS view):

| Column Name | Required | Purpose | Nullable |
|-------------|----------|---------|----------|
| SOLD_TO_CUSTOMER_NAME | ‚úÖ Yes | Customer identification | No |
| SOLD_TO_CONTRACT_NUMBER | ‚úÖ Yes | Contract identification | No |
| CONTRACT_ITEM_START_DATE | ‚úÖ Yes | Contract period start | No |
| CONTRACT_ITEM_END_DATE | ‚úÖ Yes | Contract period end | No |
| CONTRACTED_AMOUNT | ‚úÖ Yes | Base capacity amount | No |
| CURRENCY | ‚úÖ Yes | Currency for all amounts | No |
| ROLLOVER_AMOUNT | ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional | Rollover capacity (defaults to 0) | Yes |
| FREE_USAGE_AMOUNT | ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional | Free usage credits (defaults to 0) | Yes |
| CONTRACT_ITEM_ID | ‚úÖ Yes | Unique contract identifier | No |
| ~~CAPACITY_TYPE_NAME~~ | ‚ùå Removed | Was never used | N/A |

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Run the Verification Script
```sql
-- Execute the queries in verify_schema.sql
-- This will confirm the schema and identify any issues
```

### 2. Test Contract Usage Report
After redeploying the fixed code:
1. Navigate to the "Contract Usage Report" tab
2. Select a customer with active contracts
3. Verify that:
   - ‚úÖ No SQL errors appear
   - ‚úÖ Contract metrics display correctly
   - ‚úÖ Run rate calculations are reasonable
   - ‚úÖ Overage projections make sense
   - ‚úÖ Charts render properly

### 3. Validate Calculations
Compare the dashboard results with manual calculations:

**Sample Validation:**
```sql
-- Get a specific contract
SELECT 
    SOLD_TO_CUSTOMER_NAME,
    CONTRACTED_AMOUNT,
    ROLLOVER_AMOUNT,
    FREE_USAGE_AMOUNT,
    (CONTRACTED_AMOUNT + COALESCE(ROLLOVER_AMOUNT, 0) + COALESCE(FREE_USAGE_AMOUNT, 0)) AS TOTAL_CAPACITY
FROM SNOWFLAKE.BILLING.PARTNER_CONTRACT_ITEMS
WHERE SOLD_TO_CUSTOMER_NAME = 'YOUR_CUSTOMER_NAME'
  AND CONTRACT_ITEM_END_DATE >= CURRENT_DATE;

-- Get usage for that contract
SELECT 
    SUM(USAGE_IN_CURRENCY) AS TOTAL_USAGE
FROM SNOWFLAKE.BILLING.PARTNER_USAGE_IN_CURRENCY_DAILY
WHERE SOLD_TO_CUSTOMER_NAME = 'YOUR_CUSTOMER_NAME'
  AND USAGE_DATE BETWEEN 'CONTRACT_START' AND 'CONTRACT_END';
```

## Potential Issues to Watch For

### 1. NULL Values
**Risk:** NULL values in ROLLOVER_AMOUNT or FREE_USAGE_AMOUNT
**Mitigation:** Code uses `.get(column, 0)` which defaults to 0 ‚úÖ

### 2. Multiple Contracts per Customer
**Current Behavior:** The app displays one contract at a time
**Note:** If a customer has multiple active contracts, you need to select them individually

### 3. Contract Period Overlap
**Consideration:** If contracts overlap, usage might be counted in both
**Recommendation:** Verify your contract data has no overlapping periods for the same customer

### 4. Time Zone Considerations
**Current:** Uses `datetime.now().date()` for "today"
**Note:** Ensure this aligns with your billing time zone

## What Changed

### Before (Causing Error)
```python
query = f"""
SELECT 
    SOLD_TO_CUSTOMER_NAME,
    SOLD_TO_CONTRACT_NUMBER,
    CAPACITY_TYPE_NAME,  ‚Üê This column doesn't exist
    CONTRACT_ITEM_START_DATE,
    ...
"""
```

### After (Fixed)
```python
query = f"""
SELECT 
    SOLD_TO_CUSTOMER_NAME,
    SOLD_TO_CONTRACT_NUMBER,
    CONTRACT_ITEM_START_DATE,  ‚Üê Removed the non-existent column
    ...
"""
```

## Conclusion

### ‚úÖ Issue Resolved
The SQL compilation error has been fixed by removing the non-existent `CAPACITY_TYPE_NAME` column from the query.

### ‚úÖ Calculations Validated
All contract usage calculations are mathematically correct and properly handle edge cases:
- ‚úÖ Capacity calculation includes all sources (contracted + rollover + free)
- ‚úÖ Usage calculation correctly sums consumption over contract period
- ‚úÖ Overage calculation properly identifies excess consumption
- ‚úÖ Run rate projections use appropriate time periods
- ‚úÖ NULL value handling is implemented correctly
- ‚úÖ Division by zero is protected

### ‚úÖ No Data Loss
The removed column was never used in the application, so there's no functional impact.

### üìã Next Steps
1. Run `verify_schema.sql` to confirm your database schema
2. Redeploy the updated `streamlit_app.py` to Snowflake
3. Test the Contract Usage Report tab
4. Verify calculations match your business requirements

## Questions to Consider

1. **Do you need capacity type information?**
   - If yes, we need to identify if there's an alternative column
   - Run the verification script to see what's available

2. **Are the calculation formulas correct for your business?**
   - Review the formulas above
   - Confirm that contracted + rollover + free usage = total capacity

3. **Is the run rate period appropriate?**
   - Currently defaults to 30 days
   - Can be adjusted via the UI (3, 7, 14, or 30 days)

If you have any concerns about the calculations or need to add capacity type tracking, please let me know!
