# Changelog

All notable changes to the Snowflake Billing Dashboard will be documented in this file.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-11

### üêõ Bug Fixes

#### Contract Usage Report SQL Error (CRITICAL)
- **Issue:** Contract Usage Report tab was throwing SQL compilation error
- **Error Message:** `(42000): SQL compilation error: error line 4 at position 12 invalid identifier 'CAPACITY_TYPE_NAME'`
- **Root Cause:** Query was attempting to SELECT non-existent column `CAPACITY_TYPE_NAME` from `PARTNER_CONTRACT_ITEMS` view
- **Fix:** Removed `CAPACITY_TYPE_NAME` from SELECT statement in `load_contract_data()` function (line 783)
- **Impact:** No functional impact - column was never used in the application
- **Files Changed:** `streamlit_app.py`
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed and ready for testing

### ‚úÖ Validated

#### Contract Calculation Formulas
All formulas reviewed and confirmed mathematically correct:

1. **Capacity Calculation** (Line 449)
   ```python
   capacity_purchased = CONTRACTED_AMOUNT + ROLLOVER_AMOUNT + FREE_USAGE_AMOUNT
   ```
   - ‚úÖ Correct formula
   - ‚úÖ NULL handling implemented with `.get(column, 0)`

2. **Usage Calculation** (Line 462)
   ```python
   total_used = customer_usage['USAGE_IN_CURRENCY'].sum()
   ```
   - ‚úÖ Correctly filters by contract period
   - ‚úÖ Sums all usage within date range

3. **Overage Calculation** (Line 465)
   ```python
   overage = max(0, total_used - capacity_purchased)
   ```
   - ‚úÖ Returns only positive overages
   - ‚úÖ Returns 0 if under capacity

4. **Run Rate Calculations** (Lines 480-491)
   ```python
   daily_rate = recent_usage['USAGE_IN_CURRENCY'].sum() / actual_days
   days_until_overage = remaining_capacity / daily_rate
   annual_run_rate = daily_rate * 365
   ```
   - ‚úÖ All formulas mathematically correct
   - ‚úÖ Edge cases handled (division by zero, negative values)

5. **Utilization Percentage** (Line 509)
   ```python
   used_percent = (total_used / capacity_purchased * 100) if capacity_purchased > 0 else 0
   ```
   - ‚úÖ Division by zero protection
   - ‚úÖ Returns percentage 0-100+
